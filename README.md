# Project Structure and Setup

## Front-End Overview

My front-end design focuses on providing an engaging user experience with a sleek interface. It's crafted using the latest web development practices and is accessible locally at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The setup is streamlined with npm commands for package installation and server launch.

## Admin Page Details

The admin page is a pivotal part of my project, offering a robust platform for site administration. It's available at [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) following the front-end initialization. This section is equipped with essential management tools, set up via npm.

## Backend Configuration

At the core of my project lies the backend, orchestrating server-side operations and database management. It kicks off with a simple npm command that activates the server, ensuring all backend functionalities are operational.

## Project Setup Checklist:
- Database connectivity is established through `db.js`.
- Stripe's payment system is incorporated using a secret key in `.env`.
